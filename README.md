ðŸ”’ ACCOUNT LOGIN & LOGOUT FUNCTIONALITY:

The login and logout features provide secure access control, ensuring only authorized users can interact with the system.

Login Process:


Users enter their credentials (username/email and password) for authentication.

The system validates inputs, checks against stored data, and grants access upon successful verification.

Optional multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra security layer.

Session tokens or cookies are generated to maintain user access until logout or expiration.


Logout Process:


Users manually trigger logout to terminate their session.

The system invalidates the session token, clearing user data from the client side.

Redirects to a login page or home screen, ensuring no residual access remains.
